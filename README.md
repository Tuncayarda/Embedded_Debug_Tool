# Embedded Debug Tool

The **Embedded Debug Tool** is designed to simplify debugging and testing processes in embedded systems.  
It provides an extendable structure compatible with various microcontrollers and communication protocols.

## Features

- Supports multiple communication protocols (UART, SPI, I²C, etc.)  
- Modular and easily extendable architecture  
- CLI and GUI interfaces for flexible interaction  
- Real-time logging, error tracking, and performance measurement  
- Simple configuration and customization
